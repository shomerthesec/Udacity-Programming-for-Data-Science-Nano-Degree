Question 3
Finally, for each of these top 10 paying customers, I would like to find out the difference across their monthly payments during 2007. Please go ahead and write a query to compare the payment amounts in each successive month. Repeat this for each of these 10 paying customers. Also, it will be tremendously helpful if you can identify the customer name who paid the most difference in terms of payments.

A:

with t1 as (select (first_name || ' ' || last_name) as name, 
 c.customer_id, 
 p.amount, 
p.payment_date
from customer AS c
join payment AS p
on c.customer_id = p.customer_id),

t2 AS (SELECT 
t1.customer_id
FROM t1
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY SUM(t1.amount) DESC
LIMIT 10)

SELECT 
date_trunc('month', t1.payment_date) AS payment_month,
t1.name,
SUM(t1.amount) sum1,
COALESCE( 
(SUM(t1.amount) - 
LAG(SUM(t1.amount)) OVER (partition by name) ) , 0 ) AS diff
FROM t1
JOIN t2 ON t1.customer_id = t2.customer_id
WHERE t1.payment_date BETWEEN '20070101' AND '20080101'
GROUP BY 2,1
order by 4 desc
