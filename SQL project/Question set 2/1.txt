Question 1:
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

A:

select distinct
date_part('month',rental_date) as m , 
date_part('year',rental_date) as y,
s.store_id,
count(rental_id) over 
(partition by date_part('month',rental_date)
 order by s.store_id ) as rental_count

from store s
join staff st on s.store_id = st.store_id
join rental r on st.staff_id = r.staff_id
order by 2, 1
