Q:
Question 2
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

A:

select 
distinct f.title film_name,
ca.name category_name,
f.rental_duration,
NTILE(4) over ( order by f.rental_duration )  qntile
from category ca join film_category fc 
on ca.category_id = fc.category_id and ca.name in ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family' ,'Music')
join film f on fc.film_id = f.film_id
order by qntile
